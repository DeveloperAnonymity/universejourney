# The Journey of the Universe
An interactive by Yanfu Fan [best played in full screen]

Have you ever wondered how the Universe was formed? Well, this interactive takes you through just that! Below is the overview of the stages.

## Stages

### Stage 1: The Beginning 
At the beginning, the universe was squished into an infinitely hot and dense point, so small that you can’t even see with a microscope, called The Singularity. We do not know what happened before then, but this is where our journey begins.

### Stage 2: Cosmic Expansion
Suddenly, <i>The Singularity</i> started to grow bigger and bigger, like how you blow a balloon. This process is called <i>Cosmic Expansion</i>. It grew so fast that the universe was over 1 billion billion trillion times bigger than before in less than a second.

### Stage 2.1: Cooling down
Think of a box of bouncing marbles. If the box is bigger, then the marbles have more space to bounce. Now, imagine energy as the marbles and the universe as the box. As the universe becomes bigger, energy is less packed together, so the temperature becomes colder. But it is still too hot for anything to form.

### Stage 3: Formation of neutrons, protons and electrons
Now, the universe is finally cool enough for some things to form. The first objects to form are protons, neutrons and electrons, which make up an atom. But it is still too hot for the atom to form!

### Stage 3.1: Formation of Nuclei
The temperature is now low enough for the first nuclei to form. Think of protons, neutrons and electrons as lego blocks. A nucleus is the lego structure formed when you place at least one proton block (optionally with some more protons and neutrons) on the base plate.

### Stage 3.2: Formation of Atoms
Now, the temperature is low enough for the first atoms to form. Thinking of lego blocks again, an atom is what you get when you place an electron lego block on a nucleus structure.

### Stage 4: Dark Ages
The universe is quite cool now. Because it isn’t that hot, and atoms don’t emit light, the universe became transparent, without much light. The only light back then was in the form of a thing called <i>Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation</i>, which we can see today! This remains a very important evidence of the Big Bang.

### Stage 4: Dark Ages (cont.)
Since it was very dark, this part of the universe was called the <i>Dark Ages</i>. But it was 
also an age of change; gravity, which is the force that causes things to fall, caused atoms to 
come together into heavy clumps. Eventually, these clumps of atoms…

### Stage 5: Stars and Galaxies
… formed stars and galaxies! These stars and galaxies are the building blocks of the 
universe that we see today. They are made of the same atoms that were formed earlier, but 
they crash together in the stars to make light. This light is what we see when we look into the night sky.

### Stage 6: Cont. Expansion
As stars and galaxies move away from us, their light becomes redder than it really is. This is 
called <i>Redshift</i>. The further away something is, the more red shifted it is. Most stars 
and galaxies are redshifted, meaning that they are moving away from us, telling us that the 
universe is still expanding. 

### Stage 7.1: The Future?
Maybe the universe will continue to expand forever. This theory is called the Big Rip theory.

### Stage 7.2
Or maybe gravity will cause everything to come back together into another Singularity, and 
that Singularity may explode again into a new universe. This is called the Big Crunch and 
Big Bounce theory.

### Credits
Ultimately, we don't know what will happen in the future. But we do know that the universe has come a long way since the beginning. It has been a journey of change, growth, and discovery. And it is a journey that we are still on today.
